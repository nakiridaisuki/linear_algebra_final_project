\section{Abstract}
In this project, we will be discussing the math behind donut.c,
an open source project written by Andy Sloane.
\par
The code displays a rotating animation of a donut when executed, 
and the writer also used ASCII characters that differ in filling percentages to simulate luminance. 
Our goal of this project is to dive into the technical and mathematical details of donut.c, 
and to also utilize the priciples and mathematics we've discovered along the way to create a more general version of the project. 
Goals include creating code that rotates and animates a 3-D heart etc.
